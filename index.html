<p>Hello there, my name is Candace Ruby. </p> <img src="http://www.trailerlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2-12139-Vermont-Fall-Foliage-Kimberly-Vardeman.jpg"alt="My Image"> <p> I am from Essex Junction, Vermont, and I'm a first year student in the Public History MA Program at Northeastern. I received my undergraduate degree from Assumption College in May 2015, where I studied History and Foundations of Western Civilization. My primary historical area of interest is early modern Europe, and during the fall of 2013, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Rome, Italy. This was an enormously valuable experience and it provided me with many opportunities for research and on-site visits. I have interned in the archives of the Worcester Historical Museum, where I was able to process collections and assist in the digitization process. I later interned at the American Antiquarian Society and assisted with research needs.</p>
